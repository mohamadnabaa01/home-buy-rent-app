# home-buy-rent-app
This app is done for the final project of Mobile Computing course. The app will enable users to enter either as a seller or a buyer. In case the user enters as a buyer, the user can check a list of homes available for rent or sale, and can contact via email or phone number with the dealer. On the other hand, if the user wishes to be a seller, he/she can add homes for rent or sale that will be visible to all other users. The app has authentication and authorization such as login and register for a new account.
